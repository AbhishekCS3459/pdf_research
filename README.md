Abstract: This branch of computer science is concerned with making computers behave like humans. Artificial intelligence includes game playing, expert systems, neural networks, natural language, and robotics. Currently, no computers exhibit full artificial intelligence (that is, are able to simulate human behavior). The greatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now capable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are proving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing. There are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost exclusively for AI applications . The two most common are LISP and Prolog . Artificial intelligence is working a lot in decreasing human effort but with less growth.

# Introduction

Artificial intelligence is defined as developing

Wormhole (AKA the Einstein-Rosen Bridge) is a theoretical concept and a solution to Einstein'

field equations of general relativity. Simply put, wormholes are tunnels connecting two different regions of space-time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.). Although scientists are still unaware about the implications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in a black hole, they seem to be able to provide the immense forces of gravity required to curve spacetime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a plausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to the infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a wormhole would collapse the moment it forms by sinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize a wormhole, a substance known as "exotic matter" i.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density, is required. Although this substance exists mathematically, it hasn't been detected in the observable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However, counter arguments have come forward in light of new research suggesting that if there is a quantum connection (Fig 3) between two black holes, "exotic matter" may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If such wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then quantum information entering the black hole will be able to travel through the wormhole into another part of the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss According to the current mining situation and the of information in a black hole (Wolchover, 2017). However, as none of this research has empirical evidence, no definitive claims can be made. As the name suggests, white holes are fundamentall opposite to black holes. While it is impossible to escape from a black hole, it would be impossible to enter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and black holes look similar in nature when observed from space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is what differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole would almost be like a "time reversal" of viewing a black hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at best can be called an impossible possibility, mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence of a white hole on the other side of a black hole, a wormhole would be required to exist inside the black hole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As seen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to be true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second law of thermodynamics â€“entropy (a measure of how many different states particles in a system can be in) in the universe can either remain the same or it can increase; however. computer programs to solve complex problems by applications of processes that are analogo

bottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined

that the hydraulic fracturing is carried out at the level of -210 m to -434 m, with a hole depth of 224 m, at -210 m horizontal drilling downward vertical drilling. Therefore, according to the obtained final mining range at the level of -434 m is measured, and it is finally determined that the range of parallel ore body strike of 850 m and vertical ore body strike of 350 m is the hydraulic fracturing construction area.

Maternal health is the health care service of women during pregnancy, childbirth, up to the postpartum period. These services are provided with an intention to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality (1, 2). 'WHO indicates that maternal health should help the mother to fulfill natural experience that is emotional to the mother and reduce potential challenges where they suffer health -wise and sometimes even death'. Prior to COVID -19 pandemic, maternal health was already affected by increased maternal mortality and morbidity attributed to decreased socialeconomic status, cultural values and geographical remoteness. These factors increase the risk for pregnancy -related illnesses, negative consequences after birth and maternal death more in developing countries than in developed countries. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic is feared to have negative impact on maternal health (3-5). Despite sex-disaggregated data on SARSCoV2 mortalities suggesting more severe health outcomes for men than women, there are concerns that the disease could disproportionately burden women in a social and economic sense (4, 6). Therefore, it is a particularly significant question whether pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS -CoV -2 or might develop severe disease outcomes or suffer SARS -CoV2 associated consequences considering the impact of the pandemic and pandemic-control policies.

# Quality Appraisal

Studies were appraised for quality using critical appraisal tools (CADIMA) for systematic reviews developed by the University of Adelaide, South Australia. A rating scale of 0 to 4 is used based on the following criteria/

Considering the deep-hole hydraulic fracturing parameters in Northparks Copper Mine, Chuquicamata Copper Mine in Chile and other similar mines, the current mining situation and economic factors, staggered hole layout is adopted in the fracturing area, and the specific hydraulic fracturing pretreatment parameters are shown in Table 2.

# Discussion

The study is an effort to identify how an incident can create ripple effect in the social media and how companies tried to cash in the opportunity. The paper is an effort to pose different questions in front of researchers and companies. Future research efforts in this area can give valuable insights for campaign creations for different brands. This paper also can help future research for the comparison of celebrities and influencers with respect to advertising different brands and finally creating a strong brand image. There is a need for collecting primary data to substantiate this in future and also more examples might be required to give more insights into the phenomenon of brand endorsement.

# Conclusion

Until now we have discussed about the significant features of artificial intelligence i.e. it's benefits, technologies , it's precise and a good definition. Now we can say that making a machine or say robot is not as easy as an chu tiye ABC. It is difficult to make a machine like humans which can show emotions or think like humans in different circumstances.

Now we have accepted that artificial intelligence is the study of how to make things which can exactly work like humans do. It is the way in which we think sensibly, act wisely, think like humans, work like humans. W har am kh or e know that through artificial intelligence, even computer has defeated human in chess. So we can say that reaching so far has not gone waste, somehow, it is contributing towards the advancement in the Artificial intelligence.

At present, there is no computer showing full

artificial intelligence m a d a r , but the c h o d course of making machines like ourselves is on its path.

# Future Scope

It is not easy to predict the future of Artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence in the 90's was focused just about enhancing human circumstances. But is that the only goal in the future? Research is centered on bho s adike constructing human-like machines or robots. This is because scientists are concerned in human intelligence and are awestruck by trying to copy it. If machines ma a k e la v de start doing the work done by humans then, the role of humans will definitely change. The hard work of researchers may pay them off someday and we will find our work done by machines and a robot walking with us.
